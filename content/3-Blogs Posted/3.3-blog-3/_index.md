# MIGRATING MULTI-MODEL AI AGENTS TO AMAZON BEDROCK

Building sophisticated Artificial Intelligence assistants (AI Agents) often requires a combination of different Foundation Models (FMs) to handle specialized tasks. However, self-managing and orchestrating the communication flow between these models creates a significant infrastructure barrier. This article analyzes the method of migrating a self-managed multi-model AI Agents architecture to the fully managed **Amazon Bedrock Agents** and **Core Runtime** services.

## Key features of the solution:

* **Simplifying Orchestration:** Instead of having to build complex logic frameworks to manage the AI's reasoning chain, Amazon Bedrock Agents automatically analyze natural language, break down tasks, and decide to call the appropriate APIs or retrieve relevant data (ReAct prompting).
* **Multi-Model Flexibility:** Bedrock Core Runtime allows developers to easily switch or combine multiple leading models (such as Anthropic Claude, Amazon Titan, Meta Llama) within the same workflow to optimize cost and performance for each specific task (e.g., a lightweight model for routing, a powerful model for text generation).
* **Seamless Integration with Knowledge Bases:** Simplifies the deployment of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture by directly connecting the Agent to enterprise data repositories, helping the AI provide accurate, contextual answers and minimizing hallucinations.
* **Operational Optimization and Security:** Completely eliminates the server management burden (Serverless AI). Customer and training data are kept secure within a VPC environment, complying with AWS's strict security standards.
* **Practical perspective for Computer Science:** This migration process provides an important lesson on AI-integrated Software Architecture design. It illustrates the shift from developing local models to leveraging managed MLOps/LLMOps platforms on the cloud for scalability.
